### single:
training as well as sampling from normal gaussian with parameters as in params.py.

### GMM:
training as well as sampling from mixture of two gaussians([0,1], [1,1]) with parameters as in params.py.

Obtain models by training and then use generate.py.

*make new directories* - models and results/results2

### codes:
